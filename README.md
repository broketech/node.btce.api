# node.btce.api
Simple Node.js wrapper for btc-e.com exchange public API.

This module requires request. '$npm install request' in your work directory, 
then add 'var btce = require('./node.btce.js');' to your working file.

A file called 'scratch.js' with a small example has been included.  
Currently only public calls are supported.

# TODO
  1.  Add private calls.
  2.  Package and make available via NPM.
  3.  Flush out rest of v3 public API.
